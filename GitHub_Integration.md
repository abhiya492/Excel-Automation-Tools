# GitHub Integration Instructions

This guide explains how to push the Excel Automation Tools project to your GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

1. Git installed on your computer
2. GitHub account
3. Basic familiarity with Git commands

## Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

Open a terminal or command prompt in your project directory and run:

```bash
git init
```

## Step 2: Create .gitignore File

Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude temporary Excel files and other unnecessary files:

```
# Excel temporary files
~$*.xls*
*.tmp
*.xlk
*.log

# Windows system files
Thumbs.db
Desktop.ini

# macOS files
.DS_Store

# Personal files that shouldn't be shared
personal_data.xlsx
credentials.txt
```

## Step 3: Add Files to Git

Add all project files to the Git repository:

```bash
git add .
```

## Step 4: Commit Changes

Make your first commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Excel Automation Tools project"
```

## Step 5: Connect to GitHub Repository

### Option 1: Connect to Existing Repository

If you already have a repository named "Excel-Automation-Tools" on GitHub, connect to it:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/abhiya492/Excel-Automation-Tools.git
```

### Option 2: Create New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. Log in to your account
3. Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
4. Name it "Excel-Automation-Tools"
5. Provide a description: "A comprehensive set of Excel VBA tools for automating data processing, reporting, and validation."
6. Keep it public (or private if preferred)
7. Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we'll push our existing ones)
8. Click "Create repository"
9. Follow the instructions on GitHub to push an existing repository

## Step 6: Push to GitHub

Push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin main
# or if you're using the master branch
git push -u origin master
```

## Step 7: Verify Repository

1. Go to your GitHub profile: https://github.com/abhiya492
2. You should see the "Excel-Automation-Tools" repository listed
3. Click on it to verify all files were pushed correctly

## Project Structure on GitHub

Your repository should have the following structure:

## Maintaining Your Repository
